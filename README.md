#Ebay Web Scraper 

The scraper will fetch the first fifty listings of the desired item, extracting each items title, price, amount sold, 
seller rating, and seller feedback and storing then in a csv file. The user has the choice to filter their results by
price and item condition. Of those fifty listings, the mean price, seller positive feedback, and seller rating is outputted
along with a histogram displaying the distribution of item prices. Lastly, the system will return a URL to the best item found
within the fifty listings.

This scraper runs on Jupyter Notebook

Below is an example run through of the program:
