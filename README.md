# Ebay-Web-Scraper
   The Ebay Web Scraper will take an input of an item by the user and generate metrics based on the first 50 search results on Ebay. 
The user can either choose to filter their search results by price or item condition. Lastly, the URL to the best fitted item out of
the first 50 items will be displayed for the user to travel to. 

   The item that is inputed does need to be very specific and will generate incorrect results if the searched item description is too
obscure.
